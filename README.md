# Project Genesis

Project Genesis is a mobile application for YoungLife at Boise State University. The source for that application is private and hosted in another repository.

This repository is a simple website with links to the App Store and Google Play listings and some credit to the developers of the application. It is served at [https://ylboisestate.app](https://ylboisestate.app) for the purpose of sharing the app.



### Developers

Anyone updating this in the future, you can simply clone the repo and serve it from the root of the project by running `php -S localhost:1234` and hitting that in a browser.

After you `firebase login` you can `firebase deploy` to update the site. If you don't have the firebase CLI installed already, simply `npm i -g firebase-tools`
